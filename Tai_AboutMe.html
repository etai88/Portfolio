                           Engineering has always been interesting to me. The prospect of building and designing things was such an amazing idea to me. My career goal as of now is to become an engineer. I am in my second year of high school and I am currently taking POE Principles of Engineering), which teaches us about all aspects of engineering to help us decide what field we would like to join. I plan to take more classes in the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School like computer science and maybe computer integrated manufacturing. I also plan on taking a few more engineering classe during the school year or during the summer.

I was in the robotics club and so far the group I am in has created a car that is controlled manually by a remote. We displayed our car at a booth during the homecoming carnival where the participants have the chance to navigate the car through a maze and then roll a ball into a goal all with the robot. I enjoyed being a team player and playing my part. I had another group project in IED, where we were asked to build a car out of recyclable materials. I took leadership of the team as the project manager and delegated task for everyone in the group to do while contributing to the progress of the team. The team worked together great and we met all the deadlines. Our car ended up going the farthest in the class and we had excellent customer grading. I have also played sports for a few years and playing sports has taught me to be humble and to be a team player. I have also been in a math class for 3 years now where all of my classmates are older than me and have had much more experience than me. Iâ€™ve learned to listen and take advice rather than be stubborn.

    I am excited to learn more in engineering and to see where engineering will take me. The engineering classes I have been taking so far have been fun and I want to continue taking with it. Feel free to explore my portfolio and I hope you will find something useful.
