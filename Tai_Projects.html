			 In the race car project, my team and I were were asked to create a race car using only recycled material. The car can have a maximum of twelve inches of string and twelve inches of tape. Also, it must be powered by a mouse trap. Another requirement is that it must go at least 4 meters. Our car went 8 meters which was the furthest in the class. We had to model the car and the mousetrap used to power the car in inventor. I assigned task for each person in my team as well as doing task myself. This project helped me learn how to be a better leader and team member and also improved my skills in Autodesk Inventor.

                     	    In the solar hydrogen vehicle project, my team and I were were asked to create a car that is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell and by a solar cell. We would then run test on the cars using either the hydrogen fuel cell or the solar cell and make a conclusion on which power source is more efficient. A few constraints were that the car itself must be at most 5”x12” and must be made using VEX parts and banana plugs. 

In this projects, I helped with building and breadboarding as well as running test. I also worked on documentation. All together, the team worked well together and produced a very well made car. Our car received positive feedback and compliments.

                     	   In the train car project, we were asked to design a virtual train car with different designs for kids that the Lionel Train Company could sell. There were 4 team members in the group and we each had to design a train car with a food culture design. 

Our theme was food from around the world. After designing and modeling our cars on Autodesk Inventor, we showed our cars to elementary school students from a local school. Everyone loved the car designs and gave positive feedback. Throughout the project, the whole team communicated and worked together to get things done. One of our team members was absent for a weeks, so the whole team adapted and worked together to finish what he needed to do. I did created my train car, created the technical drawings, and

                     	  In this Scratch Project Assignment, we were asked to create a game. Our game needed to allow users to use keyboard and/or mouse input in a way that fundamentally affects what happens. Our game also needed to have various stages or levels in which difficulty changes or the state of the game changes in order for the user to experience more. In this project, I programmed the game and worked a bit on the documentation creating the flow chart and updating the daily log as well as correcting errors.

                     	  In the MIT App Inventor Project, we were given a base app to build our game off of. In this case we chose golf as our base code. My partner and I created sketches and brainstormed ideas and finally decided to go with Cup Pong building off the golf code. I programmed the code with the help of my partner. My partner did the majority of documentation. I helped to update the daily log, create the response table, and type up brainstorm ideas.
